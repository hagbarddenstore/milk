#Project Milk

Milk is like karate. A minimalistic yet scalable PHP 5.3 framework built for speed and accuracy.

*Disclaimer: Milk is under heavy development and lacks documentation. Any use of this code, partly or full, is to be remain limited to development, testing and/or educational purpose and is done so solely on your own responsibility. The state of the code is considered to be in a pre-alpha stage and should therefor be handled as such.*

##Unit tests

We love test-driven development and offer numerous unit tests and suites for you to play with. These tests will lay the ground-work for further development and releases. We use the unit test framwork PHPUnit 3.5.13 by Sebastian Bergmann.

##Tab indentation

Milk's source code is indented by using tabs, and looks best when using a tab size of 4. Since most browser default to a tab size of 8 it won't look that great when viewed online. This can be circumvented by using a extension for your browser that lets you customize the tab size.

* Chrom(ium/e): [Tab character size](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jkinehliihgaggijmodoknbhlkhmempc#)
* Firefox: [Tabinta](http://tabinta.mozdev.org/)

##Requirements

* PHP 5.3.3 or later
* PECL yaml 1.1 or later
